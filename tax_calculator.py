Title: Simple U.S. Federal Income Tax Bracket Calculator

@author: Craig A. Willits Jr

What it does:
- Select filing status: single or married filing jointly
- Enter gross income
- Choose standard deduction (default) or custom deduction
- Computes taxable income (simplified) and progressive tax per bracket
- Prints marginal bracket, bracket-by-bracket taxes, total tax, effective rate

Notes:
- This is federal INCOME tax only (no FICA, no state tax, no credits).
- Brackets and standard deductions are sourced from IRS releases. See citations in your post.
