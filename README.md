# U.S. Federal Tax Bracket Calculator (Python)

A command-line Python program that estimates U.S. federal income tax using
progressive tax brackets.

This project was built as a learning exercise to better understand:
- Progressive taxation
- Marginal vs effective tax rates
- User input validation
- Clean, modular Python design

## Features
- Supports Single and Married Filing Jointly
- Handles standard or custom deductions
- Progressive tax calculation by bracket
- Displays marginal and effective tax rates
- Clean tax summary output
- Restartable CLI workflow

## What This Does NOT Include
- Payroll taxes (FICA)
- State or local taxes
- Credits or phaseouts

## Example Output
=== Federal Tax Summary ===
- Gross income: $64,200
- Taxable income: $32,700
- Total federal tax: $3,447
- Marginal rate: 12%
- Effective rate: 5.37%


## Why I Built This
I wanted a hands-on way to understand how U.S. tax brackets actually work
instead of relying on online calculators. This project helped reinforce and build upon both Python fundamentals and real-world economic concepts.
